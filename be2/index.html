I teach accounting courses at several locations in the city, and I think that I have a course that would be perfect for what you are doing at Business U.\n\n\"Accounting Basics for Entrepreneurs\" is a course I have taught at many different schools. It differs from many courses in that it is designed for people who have no accounting experience, but are running their own businesses. Many small business owners have to do multiple jobs, and this class gives them some additional tools.\n\nI usually teach the course two evenings a week for eight weeks. Right now, I have Monday and Wednesday evenings available. I could also teach the course three evenings a week, but that would run for only five weeks. If you are interested, we can discuss those times and dates later.\n\nPlease feel free to call me at 555-998-8787 if you are interested in offering this course or you have any questions.\n\nThank you very much.\nLinda Chase",

This unit will forever change the way you clean your home or office.\n\nThe 900's technology is taken from our industrial line of vacuums and shop vacuums. These units typically have a much greater airflow than the average home vacuum cleaner. We've created a smaller, more portable vacuum with the same cleaning power as an industrial shop vacuum.\n\nWhat does this mean for you? First, quicker cleaning: more airflow means faster cleaning of each room. Second, deeper cleaning: higher strength means deeper cleaning of carpets, rugs, and upholstery. Finally, more flexibility: a group of useful attachments paired with increased power means you will be able to clean difficult areas like garages and car interiors easily.\n\nEven if you don't need the most powerful vacuum on the market, it's priced to beat our competitors hands down.

However, we have yet to receive an estimate for the cost of making the suggested changes.\n\nWe had planned to start the remodel next month, as many of our residents will be away from the retirement home for a group sightseeing trip during that time. Closing the kitchen while all our residents are here would be a considerable interruption to our routine, so we thought the week of October 15 is the best time for us to undertake such a project.\n\nWe were told that we would receive an estimate roughly one week ago, but have yet to receive any information.

I really didn't have any great ideas until I happened to see an ad for this place called High Point Retreat. It's up in the High Point Valley, about a half-hour outside of town.\n\nIt looks like it could be a great location for the meeting. They can accommodate a group twice the size of our team, so space won't be a problem. They also offer great amenities and all of the equipment we would probably need. They even run a shuttle service from downtown for people who have to be back in town by evening.\n\nI asked a friend at another software company about it and she said that her company has a weekend vacation there every year. They love it and she said that the rates are really reasonable. I know it's a bit far from the city, but it might be a good way to get people to look at office issues differently when they are a little more relaxed.\n\nI'll forward you a link to their website. Let me know if I can do anything to help you plan.\n\nJan Johnson",
