            L3_Target_Chase: "Dear Mike,\n\nIf you remember, we met at the recent Business Educators seminar and spoke briefly about my doing some classes at your college. I teach accounting courses at several locations in the city, and I think that I have a course that would be perfect for what you are doing at Business U.\n\n\"Accounting Basics for Entrepreneurs\" is a course I have taught at many different schools. It differs from many courses in that it is designed for people who have no accounting experience, but are running their own businesses. Many small business owners have to do multiple jobs, and this class gives them some additional tools.\n\nI usually teach the course two evenings a week for eight weeks. Right now, I have Monday and Wednesday evenings available. I could also teach the course three evenings a week, but that would run for only five weeks. If you are interested, we can discuss those times and dates later.\n\nPlease feel free to call me at 555-998-8787 if you are interested in offering this course or you have any questions.\n\nThank you very much.\nLinda Chase",

They have been in business for over 15 years, and relocated to Harris County last year. In 2005, they decided to move all manufacturing back to the country from overseas factories.\n\nCompanies are awarded based on average salary, vacation time and health benefits. Rightway paid the highest average salary to entry-level workers in the area and scored above average on amount of vacation time and quality of their health care plan. They also received high marks for employee morale, corporate culture and growth potential.\n\nRightway is currently the only bicycle maker doing all of their manufacturing in the country. They do use some parts made overseas, but all final construction is performed here in Harris County.",
            L3_Review_Zephyr: "Introducing the Zephyr 900 vacuum cleaner! This is the single most advanced vacuum cleaner ever built. Using patented turbine technology, the Zephyr 900 has more than twice the cleaning power of the leading vacuums on the market. This unit will forever change the way you clean your home or office.\n\nThe 900's technology is taken from our industrial line of vacuums and shop vacuums. These units typically have a much greater airflow than the average home vacuum cleaner. We've created a smaller, more portable vacuum with the same cleaning power as an industrial shop vacuum.\n\nWhat does this mean for you? First, quicker cleaning: more airflow means faster cleaning of each room. Second, deeper cleaning: higher strength means deeper cleaning of carpets, rugs, and upholstery. Finally, more flexibility: a group of useful attachments paired with increased power means you will be able to clean difficult areas like garages and car interiors easily.\n\nEven if you don't need the most powerful vacuum on the market, it's priced to beat our competitors hands down. Stop by your local Zephyr showroom today!",

The city is doing some renovations to the park on the east side of the building. They are putting in a walking path around the entire park and doing some additional improvements to the park itself.\n\nThis will create some inconvenience for the next few months, but we've been assured they will finish by the end of April or the first week of May at the very latest. There may be some noise from the machinery during the day, and increased truck traffic near the apartments during the project. We regret if this causes problems for any of you, but we really have no control over city construction. They have promised that they will stop work no later than 5:00 p.m. most days.\n\nOn the positive side, when they are finished, our residents will have a great new walking trail right next door and some improved recreational facilities in the park.

            L6_Target_Weiss: "Hillary Johnson\nIndustrial Kitchen Supply\n1414 East Madison St.\nCordelia, UT 85566\n\nDear Ms. Johnson,\n\nI am writing to inquire about a project we want to have done here at our facility. We met with one of your designers, Julian Brown, two weeks ago regarding the remodel of our kitchen facilities at the Shady Grove Retirement Home here in Oakfield. He was very helpful with several suggestions regarding appliances, plumbing and electrical upgrades to our rather old kitchen here. However, we have yet to receive an estimate for the cost of making the suggested changes.\n\nWe had planned to start the remodel next month, as many of our residents will be away from the retirement home for a group sightseeing trip during that time. Closing the kitchen while all our residents are here would be a considerable interruption to our routine, so we thought the week of October 15 is the best time for us to undertake such a project.\n\nWe were told that we would receive an estimate roughly one week ago, but have yet to receive any information. If we do not get an estimate from your company by the end of this week, we will be going with estimates from other contractors. If you are still interested in working with us, please contact me as soon as possible. I am available all day at 555-6884 ext. 45.\n\nI hope to hear from you soon.\n\nThank you,\nMike Weiss\nShady Grove Retirement Home",

I really didn't have any great ideas until I happened to see an ad for this place called High Point Retreat. It's up in the High Point Valley, about a half-hour outside of town.\n\nIt looks like it could be a great location for the meeting.

They even run a shuttle service from downtown for people who have to be back in town by evening.\n\nI asked a friend at another software company about it and she said that her company has a weekend vacation there every year. They love it and she said that the rates are really reasonable. I know it's a bit far from the city, but it might be a good way to get people to look at office issues differently when they are a little more relaxed.\n\nI'll forward you a link to their website.

Even though stores did not open for business until 10:00 in the morning, game lovers did not want to risk losing the chance to own this item.\n\nThe game is based on the award-winning animated movie of the same title released almost one year ago by Wilred Studios in Los Angeles. It features the same cast of characters including Elliot Holdu, the police chief, and Charlene Lenton, the head of detectives. With the help of the police force, these and other characters work on finding criminals in Quintion City.\n\nTo advertise this new item, Argo hired Simpson and Jaxon Marketing, an agency that specializes in the promotion of products in the entertainment industry. As part of its promotional campaign for Chief Elliot, Simpson and Jaxon had surveyed over 1,000 teenagers as to who should portray Elliot Holdu in a commercial about the product and over 800 selected Halifax-born actor Jason Demmings. Demmings portrayed Holdu in a TV commercial that ran for one month prior to the game's release.\n\nSo far, Argo has sold more than 3 million of its newest games across Canada and is expecting to double that number by the end of the week.",
